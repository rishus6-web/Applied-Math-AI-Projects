# Solvers for Partial Differential Equations: A Comparative Study of Classical and AI-Driven Methods
This repository presents a comparative study and implementation of different numerical methods for solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), 
specifically the 2D Heat Equation. The project bridges the gap between classical, battle-tested techniques and modern, AI-driven paradigms.

The core of this work includes the following solvers:
(1) A Classical Finite Difference Method (FDM) Solver, serving as a robust and verifiable baseline.
(2) An AI-Driven Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which learns the continuous solution in a mesh-free domain.
(3) A Novel Spectral Physics-Informed Neural Network (SPINN), a custom-designed architecture that operates in the Fourier domain 
to more efficiently handle problems with significant high-frequency components.

This project showcases an end-to-end workflow, from theoretical formulation and implementation to validation and 
comparative analysis, demonstrating a deep understanding of both the underlying physics and the associated computational methodologies.
